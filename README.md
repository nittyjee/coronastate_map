## How To Use our Site Application or Contribute

The app is pretty awesome, and you can use it as you wish. <br>
Our desire is to develop it into a map dashboard that people can use for any map project. There are many more features that the developers have used for other projects that we will be incorporating as well.

- To use, simply: <br>
Download the "map" file and open index.html.
All the layers and their styling are in the /timeline/js/map.js file.
